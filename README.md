# The Odin Project - Calculator Project (4)

This is the fourth and last project required in The Odin Project Foundations Course.
For this last challenge, it was required to build a calculator using everything learned about HTML, CSS and JavaScript. All optional functionalities were developed (visibility of previous operations, the ability to work with floating numbers, the ability to delete entries, etc.). 
I hope you enjoy my result :)

Tools: HTML / CSS / JavaScript
